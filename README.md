# IBM Domino Access Services API Specifications

Domino Access Services (DAS) is a family of REST APIs.  There are separate 
APIs for:

- Data (since Domino 8.5.3 UP1)
- Calendar (since Domino 9.0.1)
- Freebusy (see [the XPages extension library](http://extlib.openntf.org))
- Mail (see [the XPages extension library](http://extlib.openntf.org))

This repository contains OpenAPI specifications for DAS APIs.
Each API has a separate specification.  For example, for the freebusy API 
specification, see [freebusy.yaml](freebusy.yaml).

## Uses

You can use these API specifications with a broad range of Swagger tools.
For example:

- Use [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) to 
  generate client libraries for most popular languages and frameworks.

- Use [Swagger UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) to view API 
  documentation.  When you deploy Swagger UI to your own 
  Domino server, you can even try ad-hoc API requests
  without writing a line of client code.
