# Java samples using the DAS Data API
Sample code showing use of Domino Access Services (DAS) with Swagger
generated client code.  You can use this code to test data API
client code generated by
[Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen).

### Prerequisites
- A Domino server with the data API installed and enabled.
- At least one server database with the data API enabled.
  For example, you may want to use the demo database from
  the XPages Extension Library (XLibExt.nsf).  
- A Java development kit (JDK).  Java 7 is the minimum required
  version.
- Apache Maven to build the Java code and automatically manage
  dependencies.
- A Java client package generated from **data.yaml**.  For example,
  you can use the [online Swagger editor](http://editor.swagger.io)
  to import **data.yaml** and then generate a "Java" client.
  (*Note:* This repository does not include the generated code.)
  
### Required JARs
The generated client package includes a Maven project object module 
(**pom.xml**) identifying several required JARs.  Therefore, we
recommend you use Maven to automatically build
the project and manage its dependencies.  If you choose not to
use Maven, the list of required JARs is as currently follows:  

- gson-2.6.2.jar
- joda-time-2.9.3.jar
- logging-interceptor-2.7.5.jar
- okhttp-2.7.5.jar
- okio-1.6.0.jar
- swagger-annotations-1.5.9.jar

This list depends on the version of Swagger Codegen and is subject
to change without notice.  (In other words, you really should use
Maven!)

# Instructions
These instructions show how to build and run
[DocumentTest.java](client/data/test/DocumentTest.java).  To run
a different data API client sample, follow these same instructions
and substitute file names where appropriate.

First create a root folder and sub-folder as shown below:

```
/tests
/tests/swagger-java-client
```

The root folder name is not important.  Choose a name other than
**/tests** if necessary.

### Unzip the generated client code
Unzip the generated code to **/tests/swagger-java-client**.  When you
are finished, the contents of the folder should look something like
this:

```
docs
gradle
src
.gitignore
.swagger-codegen-ignore
.travis.yml
build.gradle
build.sbt
git_push.sh
gradle.properties
gradlew
gradlew.bat
pom.xml
README.md
settings.gradle
```

### Use Maven to build the generated client code
Build the generated client code and install it to your local Maven
repository:

```
cd /tests/swagger-java-client
mvn install
```

This step may take several seconds to complete.  Move on to
the next step only when you are sure you have a successful build:

```
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time: 4.896 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2017-02-22T14:26:49-05:00
[INFO] Final Memory: 20M/34M
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Create your data API test project
Now run the following two commands:

```
cd /tests
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=client.data.test -DartifactId=client-data-test -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
```

That second command is complicated, but when successful,
it automatically creates a new Maven project based on a common
template.  The new project is in a folder called
**/tests/client-data-test**.  You might want to take a
moment to explore the contents of the new folder now.

### Customize your test project
Look for a file named **pom.xml** in the
**/tests/client-data-test** folder.  Open **pom.xml**
in your favorite text editor and add the following lines
inside the existing `<dependencies>` element:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.swagger</groupId>
    <artifactId>swagger-java-client</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

Save your changes to **pom.xml**.

Now download [DocumentTest.java](client/data/test/DocumentTest.java)
to the **/tests/client-data-test/src/main/java/client/data/test**
folder.  Then open your local copy of **DocumentTest.java** in a text
editor and customize the following values for your environment:

```java
// IMPORTANT: Change these values to match your test environment:
//
// - basePath is the base URL for your Domino server.
//   The data service MUST be installed and enabled
//   on the server. Be sure to change the protocol to
//   https if necessary.
//
// - username is the user name of someone with access
//   the server.
//
// - password is the user's password.
//
// - folder is database folder name relative to the Domino
//   data directory.  Use "." if the database is in the
//   data directory itself.
//
// - database is the name of the database.  The database
//   must allow access from the data service.  Use 
//   "XPagesExt.nsf" if your server has a copy of the
//   XPages Extension Library demo database.
//
// - formName is the name of a form in the database.
//
String basePath = "http://yourserver.yourorg.com";
String username = "First Last";
String password = "password";
String folder = ".";
String database = "XPagesExt.nsf";
String formName = "AllTypes";
```

### Build your test project
Run the following two commands:

```
cd /tests/client-data-test
mvn package
```

If your build is successful, you should see the following:

```
[INFO]
[INFO] --- maven-jar-plugin:2.4:jar (default-jar) @ client-data-test ---
[INFO] Building jar: /tests/client-data-test/target/client-data-test-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time: 1.870 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2017-02-22T15:04:06-05:00
[INFO] Final Memory: 15M/25M
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### Run your test project
On Linux run the following command (note the use of *colons* to
separate folders in the classpath):

```
java -cp "target/*:../swagger-java-client/target/*:../swagger-java-client/target/lib/*" client.data.test.DocumentTest
```

On the other hand, if you are using Windows run the following
(note the use of *semicolons* to separate folders in the
classpath):

```
java -cp "target/*;../swagger-java-client/target/*;../swagger-java-client/target/lib/*" client.data.test.DocumentTest
```

Either way, the above commands run the **DocumentTest** class with
a classpath that includes the **client-data-test** JAR (`target/*`),
the generated client code (`../swagger-java-client/target/*`), and its
dependencies (`../swagger-java-client/target/lib/*`).

A successful run looks something like this:

```
Creating a new document ...
Create document request succeeded.  Location is http://yourserver.yourorg.com:80/XPagesExt.nsf/api/data/documents/unid/65720145FF81B387852580E2005E69EF

Reading document 65720145FF81B387852580E2005E69EF...
Read document request succeeded

Updating document 65720145FF81B387852580E2005E69EF...
Update document request succeeded

Reading document 65720145FF81B387852580E2005E69EF...
Read document request succeeded

Deleting document 65720145FF81B387852580E2005E69EF...
```

In other words, the **DocumentTest** class:

- Creates a new document.
- Reads the new document and validates it contains the
  expected items. 
- Updates the document.
- Reads and validates the updated document.
- Deletes the document.

The **DocumentTest** class does all of the above with relatively
simple calls into the generated client code.

### Next steps
Here are some other things to try:

- Review **DocumentTest.java** to better understand how it uses
  the generated client code.  You might even want to step
  through the code in a debugger.
  
- Add other test classes to the **client-data-test**
  project.  For example, see
  [DatabaseListTest.java](client/data/test/DatabaseListTest.java),
  [DocumentListTest.java](client/data/test/DocumentListTest.java),
  [ViewDesignTest.java](client/data/test/ViewDesignTest.java), and
  [ViewEntryListTest.java](client/data/test/ViewEntryListTest.java).
  As you add each new class, be sure to customize it for
  your test environment and rebuild the test project.  Then
  run the new class and see what it does.

- Explore the generated code in more detail.  You might even
  want to write your own application to integrate with the Domino
  freebusy API.
